About Andradion 2

I made this game a few years ago as a hobby with the help of a
classmate who did the artwork. It's fun but primitive. I never got the
multiplayer to work or made the planned "Tijuana" level, but fixing
these or any other improvement you can contribute would be very
welcome.

After leaving it sitting around for a few years, I got all the backups
I had accumulated and committed them to git in chronological order. I
made the build system more automated (see below for instructions) and
confirmed it works on post-XP Windows.

How to play

The game is saved whenever you complete a level.

1, 2, 3 - switch weapon
8, 9, 0 - change action speed (slow, normal, fast-forward)
Arrow keys - walk
Shift and arrow - strafe or walk backwards
Control - run
Space - fire weapon
P - pause
Enter - restart level
Escape - quit game

Building Andradion 2

This game only builds and runs on Windows (XP to Windows 7)

1. Clone the git repository to your machine.
git clone https://github.com/matvore/Andradion-2.git

2. Download the following software:

Java SDK (a.k.a. the JDK)
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-se-jdk-7-download-432154.html

Ant
http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi

Windows SDK version 7 (even though it says "for Windows 7", it will
run on Vista as well)
http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=3138

You can compile Andradion 2 with a different version of the SDK,
but you may have to change the Java PathConfiguration class (look in
java/src/com/github/matvore/andradion2/ant) to look for the correct
registry location for the MSVC compiler paths. Please send me a pull
request if you improve the code to support multiple versions of the
SDK.

3. Once you have all of the required packages, you just have to run
ant from the command line from the Andradion 2 folder. It will take a
few minutes and then write the executable to
out\release\andradion2.exe
